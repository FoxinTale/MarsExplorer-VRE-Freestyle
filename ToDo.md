#To do list on this world.
### Theoretically easy, I just don't know how to do.
- Replace the fake sea with actual water. or some type.
- Model-swap the buggy with the one from mars explorer. This will priobably mean the model needs to be redone. 
- Once model-swappedm, adjust the seating.. Probably be two seater at most.
- Smoke and fire effects on top of the volcano. 
- Spoarkle / shine / some type of effects on the lava runmning down the volcano. 
- Let's put like a blue crystel or orb at the spawn area, as in the original. 


### More advanced, but I would like to see. These are not dealbreakers or showstoppers. 
- Buggies should be able to drive on water while in motion, but sink once stopped.
- At the object in the scene named "Jum,p Point". If fallen into, this sends the player straight up into near- low earth orbit.
