To get this into a usable state in the Unity editor:

You'll need Unity 2019.4.31f1 installed with android build tools (Quest VR headset is an android based platform).
Then download and install the VRC creator companion https://vrchat.com/download/vcc

Once that finishes and loads up, create a new project on the left side (world). And put that in your main Github 
directory (usually C:\users\<username>\Documents\GitHub) Name the project (in this instance) 
"MarsExplorer-VRE-Freestyle", and make sure it is being created in a folder of the same name right below the project. 

Now let it do its thing , and when it finishes on the right side there's a menu, scroll down til you see "UdonSharp". 
Add it to the project and wait a bit. When done, open the project from roughly the centre of the window. 
It'll take a little while to compile the scripts on the first-time run. 

In the meantime, open Github Desktop and clone https://github.com/FoxinTale/MarsExplorer-VRE-Freestyle into a folder, 
but remove the Freestyle leaving just "MarsExplorer-VRE". And now we wait for Unity to finish compiling. 
Once it does and the main window is visible with an empty scene, close Unity. Now, copy and replace the contents of "MarsExplorer-VRE" into 
the other folder "MarsExplorer-VRE-Freestyle". Now delete the whole "MarsExplorer-VRE" folder.
